### Kafka Producer

The real-time global econpmy requires an event-driven architecture, where strategic incidences can be responded to with high performance and integrity. For companies competing at the edge, where readiness is an attribute of excellence, Kafka plays a critical role.

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. At MSS International, we recognize that taking advantage of this platform in a business requires insight, planning and execution, integrating some applications, while transforming others for the cloud

This application uses Kafka to prototype a typical streaming service, emitting product transaction and customer subscriptions to a single Kafka topic. A separate dashbaord application consumers the event, and demonstrates some of the real-time analytics that are enabled

### Usage

1. git clone
2. cd root
3. npm start

In development, point your browser to localhost:5000/ to activate streaming
